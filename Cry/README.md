# Cryptography Capture The Flag Challenges

Cryptography CTF challenges involve analyzing encrypted data, uncovering hidden keys, and breaking ciphers to extract valuable information. Players often encounter tasks such as decrypting ciphertexts, analyzing file metadata for encryption clues, recovering keys from memory dumps, and inspecting network traffic for cryptographic anomalies. These challenges test participantsâ€™ knowledge of cryptographic algorithms, key recovery techniques, and problem-solving skills, with the ultimate goal of deciphering the data to reveal the embedded flag.
