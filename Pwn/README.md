# Binary Exploitation Challenges

Binary Exploitation (Pwn) challenges require participants to analyze and exploit vulnerabilities in compiled binaries. These challenges often involve understanding how programs handle memory, utilizing techniques like buffer overflows, format string attacks, return-oriented programming (ROP), and heap exploitation. The goal is usually to manipulate the program's execution flow or extract sensitive data to retrieve the flag.
