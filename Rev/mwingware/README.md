# Challenge Name:
mwingware

## Description:

Mwingware is tired of being just a small part of challengesâ€”he wants to become the challenge itself!  

In this task, you'll be unpacking a supposedly "super-secure" Python obfuscation system called **"pya\*\*\*r"**. During my investigation of this obfuscation system, I discovered a critical vulnerability within its code?.  

As part of this challenge, you'll be working with a sample programâ€”an extracted "dummy" version of the Mwingware program. This file, named **`*archive.py`**, contains unstable code that needs fixing. By patching it, you'll unlock the full potential to extract the *real* Mwingware program.  

This challenge encourages creativity, and participants may find multiple ways to complete it. Explore different strategies, think outside the box, and enjoy reversing, reverser !

### Important Notes:
- Running this program may pose risks to your system. **Proceed with caution**, and consider using a virtual machine (VM) for safety. 
- **The flag is divided into two parts**:
  - The format is: `first-part_second-part`
  - The second part is the **variable name** of the first part.
  - The first part already wrapped by prefix `SENTRIX{`.

Are you ready to take on the challenge and unravel Mwingware's secrets? ðŸš€
