# Challenge Name:
JSHeadache

## Description : 
The challenge is called "JS," but it also involves a Python back-end in the source code. The website has multiple vulnerabilities and possible attack vectors. Your objective is to exploit the system, gain access to the admin account, and retrieve the flag. This challenge requires a white-box approach for exploitation, so make sure to review not only the attachments but also the source code in the libraries to successfully exploit the system. It's not too difficult, so let's try your best.

Note: For local debugging, you can adjust the supervisor configuration in Docker to run app.py directly and create your own Docker Compose setup. Itâ€™s not that hard!
